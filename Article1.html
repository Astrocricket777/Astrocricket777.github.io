        <hr style="color: rgba(189, 189, 189, .4);">

        <p>The R-1 aircraft, named "Oceania" by it's pilots was a <a href="#">Crealiteenian Aircraft</a> that saw service primarily in the <a href="#">"Kraken" war</a> against the former nation, <em>The Rye Legion</em>. It was designed and manufactured by <a href="#">Henry Kane</a>, this revolutionary craft paved the way for many of Kane's aircraft, eventually forming the <a href="#">Kane Aircraft Association (KAA)</a></p>
        <p>The Oceania was designed and used as an <a href="#">Reconnacance aircraft</a>, and entered service in small incrementations with the Crealiteenian Navy in early 1912. It swiftly became a reputable aircraft by it's pilots, saying the new radial engine, <a href="#">the Hornet 1100</a>, while giving more vibrations, gave a unique profile to it's controllability. It's easy manueverability made it a favirote among many flyers, including <a href="#">Aurthur Zomengo</a> who claimed the world's first air-to-air kill when he shot an enemy pilot with his <em>.22 Swarzchva</em> in the Oceania.</p>
        <p>The Oceania served almost exclusivly as a recon aircraft, using it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem">tandem seating</a>, the navigator would grab a camera of choice and take pictures over enemy territory and would hope to come back in one piece. The Crealiteen Republic sold 110 Modified Oceania's to <a href="#">Archvozsk Empire</a> in 1914; They had their wings modified so that they could be unscrewed and rescrewed into the main fuesuelage for compactness upon a ship.</p>
        <p>From the first prototype test-flight in 1908 to the last in 1931, <em>764</em> Oceania's were produced in 8 different models.</p>

        <p>In 1907, the Chief Commander of the <em>Crealiteenian Air Force (CAF)</em>, <a href="#">Fred Artz</a>, published a request for a quick recon aircraft<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>, for the CAF had invested into aircraft but were in dire need of such because of the soon-to-come war. He requested a maximum obtainable speed of <em>125kts (143mph)</em> and a range of <em>235 miles (147 km)</em>. It needed to be able to haul signifigant weight in consideration of a camera.</p>
        <p><em>In September 1907</em>, the CAF signed a contract with Kane<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>, who would manufacture and design said aircraft. After the mock-up inspection in November 1907, construction began on a prototype aircraft designated <em>"XV-R1"</em>. As the first aircraft Kane designed, he had to take a look at many other aircrafts of the time, he was a physician and taught at a college in 1903<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>, which aided in his knowledge of <em>aerodynamics</em>. Kane suggested that a rounder fuesuelage would create less drag due to it's aerodynamic shape <sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>. He also emplyed that a Radial Engine would suit the shape. With the help of his brother, they designed the <em>"Hornet 1100"</em> with the 1100 representing the displacement of 11.00L. <sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup> After a failed first maiden flight due to an tank leak, the <em>XF-R1</em> took off for the first time on <em>January 12th 1908.</em></p>

        <h3>Engine Considerations</h3>
        <p>The R-1 used the strongest engine of the time, the 350 hp (260 kW) 9-cylinder <a href="#">Wasp 1100</a> Kane <a href="#"> radial</a>. It had a 11.5 ft (3.5 m) <em>wooden</em> propeller which was mounted directly to the engine crank shaft. The propeller was tested numerous times in order to optimize it's extraction of engine power.</p>
        

        <h3>Landing Gear And Wings</h3>
        <p>The <a href="#">landing gear</a> was connected via independent <em>struts</em> that connected to the main fuesuelage. They were built hollow to lose weight in order do give it a suspension feeling. The wheels were .88 ft (.27 m) in diameter and offered good <em>ground controllability</em> on rough surfaces such as the beaches of the Crealiteen Republic.</p>

        <h3>Camera Mounting</h3>
        <p>Considering that the R-1 Oceania was a <a href="#">reconnacance</a> aircraft, it was taken with great care choosing the correct camera. If it (the camera) were to heavy, it could <b>dramatically</b> effect the <em>aircraft's performance</em> negativly. It was eventually decided to use the <a href="#">Baylee's</a> <em>Mk.2 Camera</em> which offered very good quality imagery for the time<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup>. Early versions of the R-1 did not have a camera mount built into the aircraft itself. Instead, the navigator (the front seater) would bring a camera and take a picture manually by leaning out of the seat. After some fatal incedents with pilots falling out of the aircraft<sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup>, Kane Aeronautics designed the R-1B (Marking the previous as R-1A) which had a built-in camera rail on the belly of the aircraft.</p>
